We are happy to welcome you in our Scrum Poker documentation and hope that you find answers to the questions that brought you to this documentation!
If you are missing some information please feel welcome to <a href="">contact us</a>.

The documentation targets users of the Scrum Poker add-on and Jira administrators who administrate a Jira installation and the add-ons installed into it.
The documentation is split into these two categories:

* The `User Guide` covers topics like how to start a session, how to join and participate in an already started session and everything else around the process of getting the most out of the Scrum Poker add-on.
* The `Administration` section covers topics like installation and configuration and running the Scrum Poker add-on in your Jira instance.
* The `Legal` section holds legal documents like the Privacy Statement and the End User License Agreement.
