The documentation targets users of the Scrum Poker for Jira app and Jira administrators who administrate a Jira installation and the apps installed into it.
The documentation is split into these two categories:

* The `User Guide` covers topics like how to start a session, how to join and participate in an already started session and everything else around the process of getting the most out of Scrum Poker for Jira.
* The `Administration` section covers topics like installation and configuration and running Scrum Poker for Jira in your Jira instance.
* The `Legal` section holds legal documents like the Privacy Statement and the End User License Agreement.
