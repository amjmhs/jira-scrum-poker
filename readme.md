# Scrum Poker for Jira

Scrum Poker for Jira is an open source app enabling teams to collaboratively estimate their work with the help of an interactive user interface seamlessly integrated into Jira Software.

This app works best in combination with the Story Point field introduced by Jira Software which is also used to calculate the sprint velocity.
