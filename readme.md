# Scrum Poker

This plugin provides a Scrum poker solution for JIRA that integrates well with the JIRA Agile estimation custom field which is used to calculate the velocity of a sprint.

## Getting Started

The Atlassian Plugin SDK provides several useful commands:

* `atlas-run` installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* `atlas-debug` same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* `atlas-cli` after atlas-run or atlas-debug, opens a Maven command line window:
  * `pi` reinstalls the plugin into the running product instance
* `atlas-help` prints description for all commands in the SDK
