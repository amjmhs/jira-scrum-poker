# Scrum Poker

Scrum Poker is an open source plugin enabling teams to collaboratively estimate their work with the help of an interactive user interface seamlessly integrated into Jira Software.

This plugin works best in combination with the Story Point field introduced by Jira Software which is also used to calculate the sprint velocity.
